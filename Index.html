            Iceland, a Nordic island nation, is defined by its dramatic
            landscape with volcanoes, geysers, hot springs and lava fields.
            Massive glaciers are protected in Vatnajökull and Snæfellsjökull
            national parks. Most of the population lives in the capital,
            Reykjavik, which runs on geothermal power and is home to the
            National and Saga museums, tracing Iceland’s Viking history

        Located on a rift between tectonic plates, Iceland's geologic activity
        includes geysers and frequent volcanic eruptions. The interior consists
        of a volcanic plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains,
        and glaciers, and many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the
        lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate
        climate, despite a latitude just south of the Arctic Circle. Its high
        latitude and marine influence keep summers chilly, and most of its
        islands have a polar climate. According to the ancient manuscript
        Landnámabók, the settlement of Iceland began in 874 AD when the
        Norwegian chieftain Ingólfr Arnarson became the first permanent settler
        on the island. In the following centuries, Norwegians, and to a lesser
        extent other Scandinavians, immigrated to Iceland, bringing with them
        thralls (i.e., slaves or serfs) of Gaelic origin. The island was
        governed as an independent commonwealth under the native parliament, the
        Althing, one of the world's oldest functioning legislative assemblies.
        Following a period of civil strife, Iceland acceded to Norwegian rule in
        the 13th century. The establishment of the Kalmar Union in 1397 united
        the kingdoms of Norway, Denmark, and Sweden. Iceland thus followed
        Norway's integration into that union, coming under Danish rule after
        Sweden seceded from the union in 1523. The Danish kingdom forcefully
        introduced Lutheranism to Iceland in 1550. Influenced by ideals of
        nationalism after the French Revolution, Iceland's struggle for
        independence took form and culminated in the Danish–Icelandic Act of
        Union in 1918, with the establishment of the Kingdom of Iceland, sharing
        through a personal union the incumbent monarch of Denmark. During the
        occupation of Denmark in World War II, Iceland voted overwhelmingly to
        become a republic in 1944, thus ending the remaining formal ties with
        Denmark. Although the Althing was suspended from 1799 to 1845, the
        island republic has nevertheless been credited with sustaining the
        world's oldest and longest-running parliament.
