                      The recorded history of Iceland began with the settlement
                      by Viking explorers and the people they enslaved from
                      Western Europe, particularly in modern-day Norway and the
                      British Isles, in the late ninth century. Iceland was
                      still uninhabited long after the rest of Western Europe
                      had been settled. Recorded settlement has conventionally
                      been dated back to 874, although archaeological evidence
                      indicates Gaelic monks from Ireland, known as papar
                      according to sagas, may have settled Iceland earlier.

                        During the 11th and 12th centuries, the centralization
                        of power had worn down the institutions of the
                        commonwealth, as the former, notable independence of
                        local farmers and chieftains gave way to the growing
                        power of a handful of families and their leaders. The
                        period from around 1200 to 1262 is generally known as
                        the Age of the Sturlungs. This refers to Sturla
                        Þórðarson and his sons, Sighvatr Sturluson, and Snorri
                        Sturluson, who were one of two main clans fighting for
                        power over Iceland, causing havoc in a land inhabited
                        almost entirely by farmers who could ill-afford to
                        travel far from their farms, across the island to fight
                        for their leaders.The recorded history of Iceland began
                        with the settlement by Viking explorers and the people

                        the rest of Western Europe had been settled. Recorded

                      On 31 December 1943, the Act of Union agreement expired
                      after 25 years. Beginning on 20 May 1944, Icelanders voted
                      in a four-day plebiscite on whether to terminate the
                      personal union with the King of Denmark and establish a
                      republic. The vote was 97% in favour of ending the union
                      and 95% in favour of the new republican constitution.[43]
                      Iceland became an independent republic on 17 June 1944,
                      with Sveinn Björnsson as its first president. Denmark was
                      still occupied by Germany at the time. Danish King
                      Christian X sent a message of congratulations to the
                      Icelandic people.
